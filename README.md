Jumble
======

An Android service implementation of the Mumble protocol, designed to be used by Plumble in future releases.

Why?
=====

There's no open-source (free as in freedom) Mumble protocol implementation on Android. Jumble will serve to fill this void and aid in bringing a full-featured Mumble client to Android under the Apache License v2.

Due to the restrictive nature of the 'mumble-android' project by @pcgod, no sources or derivatives will be copied from that project.

When?
=====

Jumble should be usable by mid-July 2013.
