Jumble
======

An Android service implementation of the Mumble protocol, designed to be used as the backend of Plumble in future releases.

Note that this project will only provide a service and utilities necessary for operation, and will never be a standalone app. That's what Plumble will be for.

Why?
-----

There's no open-source (free as in freedom) Mumble protocol implementation on Android. Jumble will serve to fill this void and aid in bringing a full-featured Mumble client to Android under the Apache License v2.

Due to the restrictive nature of the 'mumble-android' project by @pcgod, no sources or derivatives will be copied from that project.

When?
-----

Jumble should be usable by mid-July 2013.

How will I be able to use this?
-----

Upon release, Jumble will be usable as an Android library project. You'll be able to interface with the service via AIDL.
